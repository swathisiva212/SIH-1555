Virtual Herbal Garden for AYUSH Education & Awareness

## Problem Description
Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

Educates users on medicinal plants.

Makes AYUSH knowledge widely accessible.

Encourages interactive and visual learning.

Appeals to students, enthusiasts, and practitioners alike.

## Use Cases
A student learning about Ayurvedic plants through guided tours.

A user bookmarks herbs related to respiratory wellness.

A researcher filters plants by native regions and medicinal category.

A teacher uses the app in classrooms with 3D plant visualizations.
